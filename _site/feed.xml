&lt;p&gt;Notes per section from 7b:
&lt;br /&gt;4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - There are two outliers in the tail of the 5% fifthtile below 20% of the genome. These are the lowest representative families across all the data including simplex trios and quads.
&lt;br /&gt;4.5 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families, Deciles 0-20% - Zoomed in from above to see the outliers better.
&lt;br /&gt;6.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Child - There are a few families near the higher end, but still all below the threshold of &amp;gt;= 10. The max counts is still only a value of 3 counts in a single family.
&lt;br /&gt;7.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child - There are four extreme outliers that should be removed and are well above our threshold of &amp;gt;= 12.
&lt;br /&gt;7.4 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child Zoomed - There is still one more family just above our threshold of &amp;gt;= 12 when we zoom in and ignore the extreme outliers.
&lt;br /&gt;8.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are two families just above the threshold of &amp;gt;= 14.
&lt;br /&gt;9.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Trans - No outliers, the max raw count is 2. There is a family near the threshold of &amp;gt;= 6 but it is just below and still only have 2 raw counts.
&lt;br /&gt;12.3 - Allele Fraction Densities, Mosaic Child - There is a bit of a bump in the AF distributions for mosaic sibling calls. This may go away with the above filtering of families but also is likely just due to the low number of calls.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is a first pass through the data for the multiplex quad families for the purposes of outlier detection.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SPARK Preliminary Pass 6a and 6b, Simplex Trio Coverages, SNV Counts, and AFs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/17/post-0031.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SPARK Preliminary Pass 6a and 6b, Simplex Trio Coverages, SNV Counts, and AFs" /><published>2021-07-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/07/17/post-0031</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/17/post-0031.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a first pass through the data for the simplex trio families for the purposes of outlier detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section from 6b:
&lt;br /&gt;4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - Appears similarly to simplex quads. There isn’t a tail. No filtering recommended again.
&lt;br /&gt;5.2 - Plot Genomic Coverage, Autosomal - Also similarily expected. To note, joint family coverages here for trios are going to be larger than simplex quad family coverages since there are fewer family members.
&lt;br /&gt;5.8 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Child - There’s a single, clear outlier that would get filtered out with the same simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 10.
&lt;br /&gt;6.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child - No outliers. Nothing would be removed with the same simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 12.
&lt;br /&gt;7.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are a few clear outliers and a few ambiguous cases like in the simplex quads. 2 families are clear outliers and 5 are near the threshold but still fall above the simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 14.
&lt;br /&gt;8.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Trans - No outliers. Nothing would be removed with the same simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 6.
&lt;br /&gt;11.1 - Plot All Allele Fraction Densities - Looks as expected. The remainder of AF plots also look as expected and in line with the simplex quads.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is a first pass through the data for the simplex trio families for the purposes of outlier detection.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SPARK Preliminary Pass 5, Final Filtering</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/14/post-0030.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SPARK Preliminary Pass 5, Final Filtering" /><published>2021-07-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/07/14/post-0030</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/14/post-0030.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a final pass through the data for the purposes of filtering, collapsing, and relabeling for the quad simplex files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the thresholds used to filter each category for the quad simplex calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mosaic_c        45x 5%, adjusted &amp;gt;=10 calls

mosaic_trans    45x 5%, adjusted &amp;gt;= 6 calls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This eliminates the following four families: SF0087337, SF0035804, SF0054730, SF0081797.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex events were addressed by hand. Events occuring in the same codon were run with their combined alternative genotype in VEP. Rows in the table were chosen by the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IF variants are multi-allelic:
	* choose variant with more severe effect (NSS &amp;gt; MIS &amp;gt; TRANSVERSION_SYN &amp;gt; TRANSITION_SYN)
IF variants potentially in the same codon (w/in 3bp):
	* keep variant with left-most coordinate
	* combine genotype
	* update functional annotation to reflect VEP annotation run on the combined effect
IF variants are nearby in different codons (w/in 100bp):
	* choose variant with more severe effect (NSS &amp;gt; MIS &amp;gt; SYN)
		* if same effect, keep nearest to a splice junction
			* if same splice junction distance, keep left-most
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChromVAR was run with R v4.0.0 using the JASPAR 2020 motif database for mm10. This was performed on the data filtered at the TSS 1.5 threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the variabilities plotted in order where the motifs are slightly different from the 1.5 thresholded version: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/kcz824kl28c21wc/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_variability.png?dl=0&quot;&gt;Variability FIgure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get enrichment of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/af88qnznirb5iya/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_KLF9.png?dl=0&quot;&gt;KLF9 (Deviations UMAP)&lt;/a&gt; motifs as well but it follows a similar distribution of motifs like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ap8ek6p7ecw4c0/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_CTCF.png?dl=0&quot;&gt;CTCF (Deviations UMAP)&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section from 4b:
&lt;br /&gt;4.5 - Decile Plots of Joint Coverage by Family - There is a bit more of a tail than by individual.
&lt;br /&gt;4.6/4.7 - Decile Plots of Joint Parent/Child Coverage by Family - The tails are more observable in these.
&lt;br /&gt;5.2 - Plot Genomic Coverage, Autosomal - Here is the comparison of joint coverage distributions alongside individual coverages. Joint coverage takes families into the 25-50% range whereas individuals are in the 50-75% range.
&lt;br /&gt;6.2 and 6.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child - There is the single outlier proband with 9 counts.
&lt;br /&gt;7.2 and 7.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Germline Child - There is a slight outlier sibling but it doesn’t show up as much in the adjusted plots in 7.3.
&lt;br /&gt;8.2 and 8.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There is a bit of a tail in the maternal calls with few outliers that are still high even in the adjusted plots.
&lt;br /&gt;9.2 and 9.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Parental Trans - All the counts seem relatively low with no outliers but the members with 2 counts do also have lower coverage and they remain high in the adjusted plots.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is a second pass through the data.

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section:
&lt;br /&gt;4 - Plots of All AF Densities - These look in line with what we expect.
&lt;br /&gt;5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2 - Plots Relative to Old, Original Data - All of this newer data is slightly right-shifted relative to the older data. This is due to the older data having more depth and more capable of getting smaller AF’s and is expected.
&lt;br /&gt;5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3 - Plots with and without Filters - The filters are pretty conservative but are taking out a large number of calls aggressively on the lower-end. The numbers of calls being thrown out from these filters are large but expected (mainly just getting rid of calls with fewer than 5 alt reads).
&lt;br /&gt;9 - Plots with and without Transmission Filters - This also shows how dramatic the PSAME and higher PHET threshold are for removing false parental transmission calls. The higher PHET threshold does seem to eliminate more calls on the higher end of AF.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup.

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section:
&lt;br /&gt;2.6 - Load/Masterlist Subset - I should bring in the full master-table down instead of this subset eventually.
&lt;br /&gt;2.7 - Load/Coverage Denominators - Move this to a loadable file eventually.
&lt;br /&gt;3.1 - Filter and Subset/Variant Filter - Right now not filtering families, add those here.
&lt;br /&gt;3.2 - Filter and Subset/Duplicate Variant Entries - This describes and collapses the situations where multiple variants for the same family are occuring (usually due to transmission). There are 5 mosaic child calls that are borderline that we are dropping here which should be fine (the full numbers for these are printed out so you can see why they are at the border). There are also many instances where a variant is called in the child but found to be mosaic in the parent who does not have an original call. I am currently dropping these on the basis of the fact that no original variant call was made for these.
&lt;br /&gt;3.3 - Filter and Subset/Collapse Complex Events - Currently not marking or collapsing complex events.
&lt;br /&gt;3.4 - Filter and Subset/Variant Reclassification to Germline - Hard reclassification of any mosaic with AF_U90_CI_AC_MAIN &amp;gt;= 0.4 as “MOSAIC_TO_GERMLINE”. Check AF plots before and after down the road.
&lt;br /&gt;3.5 - Filter and Subset/Function Reclassifications - The current categories are: nonsynonymous SNV, stopgain, stoploss, synonymous SNV, unknown. We may want to group these or add splicing information into these column.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup.

Here I am plotting preliminary coverage figures and getting SNV counts by grouping. Counting and pasting coverages per family should probably be done outside of R to actually work quickly. This is just on the quad simplex files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section:
&lt;br /&gt;4.1 - Generate Count Tables/Count Table Creation for All Variants - This takes too long in R. Just count them up outside of R.
&lt;br /&gt;5.2/5.3 - Plot/Decile Plot, All Deciles - Just choose one of percent bases or # bases going forward, doens’t matter. There’s not a dramatic tail at the bottom fifthtile but its reasonably lower than everything to just drop. Splitting out by FA, MO, PRO, and SIB shows they’re all the same.
&lt;br /&gt;5.9/5.10 - Plot/Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child, Boxplots using # SNVs and # SNVs / EXOME COVERAGE - The boxplots don’t work that well since most of the families have 0 counts in the discrete categories. These would probably be better as histograms. I wanted to plot out just the raw number of counts to see if there were outlying families with too many calls. There are a few and the ones I spot checked also have low exome coverage. Plot # of calls by Exome Coverage really quick.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup.
