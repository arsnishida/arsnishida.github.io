&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the UMAPs and how they were plot in 3d. They look as expected, similar to the 2D versions. The Bio Cluster one might indicate that one of the pg’s labeled as excitatory should be better labeled as undetermined.

&lt;p&gt;This markdown contains two parts for various figures. The first part shows the DA results from comparing pg 1 and pg 12 in the data filtered at TSS &amp;gt; 1.5. The second part contains a comparison of the results from running ChromVAR on the two TSS &amp;gt; 1.5 and 2.7 datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markdown Notes:
&lt;br /&gt;1.2 - Plot PVALS - These are terribly skewed suggesting the test itself is not a good choice.
&lt;br /&gt;1.3 - Plot FDRS - These end up all as 1 due to the issue above.
&lt;br /&gt;2.3 - Plot Variability, Spearman - The overall variabilities are well correlated with a few outliers from the KLF family.
&lt;br /&gt;2.4 - Show KLF9 and CTCF Score Correlations - The deviation scores from ChromVAR run on the TSS &amp;gt; 1.5 dataset are compared for KLF9 and CTCF. KLF9 is a variable motif under the 1.5 dataset but not the 2.7 dataset. It has a similar pattern and distribution to CTCF but this show the scores aren’t well correlated suggesting it isn’t simply an indication of quality like CTCF usually indicates.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="tbr1" /><summary type="html">Dir: /home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/sc_tmp1/encode_DHS_index/third_pass_filt_TSS2p7 Run: run_3D_plot.txt</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Single Cell TBR1 BioCluster/Genotype/Line/Time DA with TSS &amp;gt; 2.7</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/18/post-0033.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Single Cell TBR1 BioCluster/Genotype/Line/Time DA with TSS &amp;gt; 2.7" /><published>2021-07-18T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-18T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/07/18/post-0033</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/18/post-0033.html">&lt;p&gt;Dir: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/sc_tmp1/encode_DHS_index/third_pass_filt_TSS2p7/DA&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DA information of where and what was run is left here for posterity. None of the comparisons yielded significant results using the raw p-value. The DA was performed after TF normalization using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section from 6b:
&lt;br /&gt;4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - Appears similarly to simplex quads. There isn’t a tail. No filtering recommended again.
&lt;br /&gt;5.2 - Plot Genomic Coverage, Autosomal - Also similarily expected. To note, joint family coverages here for trios are going to be larger than simplex quad family coverages since there are fewer family members.
&lt;br /&gt;5.8 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Child - There’s a single, clear outlier that would get filtered out with the same simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 10.
&lt;br /&gt;6.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child - No outliers. Nothing would be removed with the same simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 12.
&lt;br /&gt;7.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are a few clear outliers and a few ambiguous cases like in the simplex quads. 2 families are clear outliers and 5 are near the threshold but still fall above the simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 14.
&lt;br /&gt;8.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Trans - No outliers. Nothing would be removed with the same simplex quad threshold of &amp;gt;= 6.
&lt;br /&gt;11.1 - Plot All Allele Fraction Densities - Looks as expected. The remainder of AF plots also look as expected and in line with the simplex quads.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is a first pass through the data for the simplex trio families for the purposes of outlier detection.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SPARK Preliminary Pass 7a and 7b, Multiplex Quad Coverages, SNV Counts, and AFs</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/17/post-0032.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SPARK Preliminary Pass 7a and 7b, Multiplex Quad Coverages, SNV Counts, and AFs" /><published>2021-07-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/07/17/post-0032</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/17/post-0032.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a first pass through the data for the multiplex quad families for the purposes of outlier detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section from 7b:
&lt;br /&gt;4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - There are two outliers in the tail of the 5% fifthtile below 20% of the genome. These are the lowest representative families across all the data including simplex trios and quads.
&lt;br /&gt;4.5 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families, Deciles 0-20% - Zoomed in from above to see the outliers better.
&lt;br /&gt;6.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Child - There are a few families near the higher end, but still all below the threshold of &amp;gt;= 10. The max counts is still only a value of 3 counts in a single family.
&lt;br /&gt;7.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child - There are four extreme outliers that should be removed and are well above our threshold of &amp;gt;= 12.
&lt;br /&gt;7.4 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child Zoomed - There is still one more family just above our threshold of &amp;gt;= 12 when we zoom in and ignore the extreme outliers.
&lt;br /&gt;8.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are two families just above the threshold of &amp;gt;= 14.
&lt;br /&gt;9.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Trans - No outliers, the max raw count is 2. There is a family near the threshold of &amp;gt;= 6 but it is just below and still only have 2 raw counts.
&lt;br /&gt;12.3 - Allele Fraction Densities, Mosaic Child - There is a bit of a bump in the AF distributions for mosaic sibling calls. This may go away with the above filtering of families but also is likely just due to the low number of calls.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is a first pass through the data for the multiplex quad families for the purposes of outlier detection.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">SPARK Preliminary Pass 5, Final Filtering</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/14/post-0030.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="SPARK Preliminary Pass 5, Final Filtering" /><published>2021-07-14T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-07-14T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2021/07/14/post-0030</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021/07/14/post-0030.html">&lt;p&gt;This is a final pass through the data for the purposes of filtering, collapsing, and relabeling for the quad simplex files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the thresholds used to filter each category for the quad simplex calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mosaic_c        45x 5%, adjusted &amp;gt;=10 calls
germline_c      45x 5%, adjusted &amp;gt;=12 calls
mosaic_nontrans 45x 5%, adjusted &amp;gt;=14 calls
mosaic_trans    45x 5%, adjusted &amp;gt;= 6 calls
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This eliminates the following four families: SF0087337, SF0035804, SF0054730, SF0081797.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex events were addressed by hand. Events occuring in the same codon were run with their combined alternative genotype in VEP. Rows in the table were chosen by the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;IF variants are multi-allelic:
	* choose variant with more severe effect (NSS &amp;gt; MIS &amp;gt; TRANSVERSION_SYN &amp;gt; TRANSITION_SYN)
IF variants potentially in the same codon (w/in 3bp):
	* keep variant with left-most coordinate
	* combine genotype
	* update functional annotation to reflect VEP annotation run on the combined effect
IF variants are nearby in different codons (w/in 100bp):
	* choose variant with more severe effect (NSS &amp;gt; MIS &amp;gt; SYN)
		* if same effect, keep nearest to a splice junction
			* if same splice junction distance, keep left-most
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first markdown includes how the data was loaded, filtered, and subset and has no plots. The second markdown contains the plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section from 4b:
&lt;br /&gt;4.5 - Decile Plots of Joint Coverage by Family - There is a bit more of a tail than by individual.
&lt;br /&gt;4.6/4.7 - Decile Plots of Joint Parent/Child Coverage by Family - The tails are more observable in these.
&lt;br /&gt;5.2 - Plot Genomic Coverage, Autosomal - Here is the comparison of joint coverage distributions alongside individual coverages. Joint coverage takes families into the 25-50% range whereas individuals are in the 50-75% range.
&lt;br /&gt;6.2 and 6.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child - There is the single outlier proband with 9 counts.
&lt;br /&gt;7.2 and 7.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Germline Child - There is a slight outlier sibling but it doesn’t show up as much in the adjusted plots in 7.3.
&lt;br /&gt;8.2 and 8.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There is a bit of a tail in the maternal calls with few outliers that are still high even in the adjusted plots.
&lt;br /&gt;9.2 and 9.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Parental Trans - All the counts seem relatively low with no outliers but the members with 2 counts do also have lower coverage and they remain high in the adjusted plots.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is a second pass through the data.

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section:
&lt;br /&gt;4 - Plots of All AF Densities - These look in line with what we expect.
&lt;br /&gt;5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2 - Plots Relative to Old, Original Data - All of this newer data is slightly right-shifted relative to the older data. This is due to the older data having more depth and more capable of getting smaller AF’s and is expected.
&lt;br /&gt;5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3 - Plots with and without Filters - The filters are pretty conservative but are taking out a large number of calls aggressively on the lower-end. The numbers of calls being thrown out from these filters are large but expected (mainly just getting rid of calls with fewer than 5 alt reads).
&lt;br /&gt;9 - Plots with and without Transmission Filters - This also shows how dramatic the PSAME and higher PHET threshold are for removing false parental transmission calls. The higher PHET threshold does seem to eliminate more calls on the higher end of AF.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup.

Here I am plotting preliminary coverage figures and getting SNV counts by grouping. This is just on the quad simplex files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the previous post but with histograms instead of boxplots for SNV counting with and without families with 0 counts removed from the plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the filter Deidre used at one point to identify outlying families that are in the ballpark of the counts we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes per section:
&lt;br /&gt;4.4 - Plot / Mosaic Child - There is a single Proband from a family with 12 counts which is a clear outlier with every other family having less than 5 counts.
&lt;br /&gt;4.7 - Plot / Germline Child - There is a single Sibling from a family with 8 counts where every other family has 5 or less.
&lt;br /&gt;4.10 - Plot / Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are two Mothers from families with 8 and 9 counts with every other family having 5 or less.
&lt;br /&gt;4.13 - Plot / Mosaic Parental Trans - There are no families with higher than 5 counts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SPARK" /><summary type="html">This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup.
