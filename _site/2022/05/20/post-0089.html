    <p>There are a few folders left on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/exacloud/gscratch/radpantry</code>. These are all copies of scripts, software, or empty folders that I do not have permission to delete. There is no data in any of these however and they can be deleted whenever.</p>

<p>None of my files exist on lustre1. But I took down the sizes of the directories remaining on lustre1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/dirsizes.lustre1.nov42021.txt</code>. The only directory copied from lustre1 was the kruppd directory which is copied here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroakdata/lustre1_kruppd</code>.</p>

<p>No other files of mine exist on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroakdata/</code>.</p>

<p>The largest sets of files available for deletion are the intermediate SPARK mosaic files, mpileups and coverages. These can be deleted for space whenever and can always be regenerated from the CRAMs.
<br />The WES1 locations are here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroakdata/TEMP_SPARK</code>.
<br />The WES2/3 locations are here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/spark_mosaic/TEMP/</code>.</p>

<p>All of my files remain solely in: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/</code>. There should be files with labels like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run.txt</code> that describe the provenance of the data in that directory.
Nearly all of them should be represented in blog posts except for older directories that are for defunct projects.
Here’s some more information about the tags for those remaining directories that do not have blog posts:
<br /> - environment - These are directories with environments for use for other projects. If people are still using them they should copy or recreate them in their directories. These can eventually be deleted.
<br /> - libraries - These are libraries I’ve maintained for use by other software. Again, if people are using these they should copy them for themselves but otherwise they can be deleted.
<br /> - plasmid - An abanonded approach but the tarball of the processing is left there.
<br /> - paternity - The output should be the Mendellian error tables and I’m pretty sure we finished fixing all the sample mixups. I know I sent Hadley a final summary but the Slack/email is too old to directly find.
<br /> - ntd - These are all compressed by their sequence date and the last one was done by Sally and is a direct copy of her directory.
<br /> - spark_validations - There are two folders of data from the NYGC. The output for these are the variant calls and IGV screenshots of the sites.</p>

<p>Below is the full list of directories:</p>
