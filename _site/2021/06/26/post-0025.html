    <p>This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup. Here I am plotting preliminary coverage figures and getting SNV counts by grouping. This is just on the quad simplex files.</p>

<p>This is similar to the previous post but with histograms instead of boxplots for SNV counting with and without families with 0 counts removed from the plots.</p>

<p>These were the filter Deidre used at one point to identify outlying families that are in the ballpark of the counts we have.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mosaic_c        45x 5%, adjusted &gt;=10 calls
mosaic_nontrans 45x 5%, adjusted &gt;=12 calls
germline_c      45x 5%, adjusted &gt;=12 calls
mosaic_trans    45x 5%, adjusted &gt;= 6 calls
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notes per section:
<br />4.4 - Plot / Mosaic Child - There is a single Proband from a family with 12 counts which is a clear outlier with every other family having less than 5 counts.
<br />4.7 - Plot / Germline Child - There is a single Sibling from a family with 8 counts where every other family has 5 or less.
<br />4.10 - Plot / Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are two Mothers from families with 8 and 9 counts with every other family having 5 or less.
<br />4.13 - Plot / Mosaic Parental Trans - There are no families with higher than 5 counts.</p>
