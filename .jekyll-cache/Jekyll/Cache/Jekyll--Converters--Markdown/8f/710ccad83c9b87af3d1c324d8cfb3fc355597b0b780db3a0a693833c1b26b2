<p>Notes per section from 7b:
<br />4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - There are two outliers in the tail of the 5% fifthtile below 20% of the genome. These are the lowest representative families across all the data including simplex trios and quads.
<br />4.5 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families, Deciles 0-20% - Zoomed in from above to see the outliers better.
<br />6.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Child - There are a few families near the higher end, but still all below the threshold of &gt;= 10. The max counts is still only a value of 3 counts in a single family.
<br />7.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child - There are four extreme outliers that should be removed and are well above our threshold of &gt;= 12.
<br />7.4 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child Zoomed - There is still one more family just above our threshold of &gt;= 12 when we zoom in and ignore the extreme outliers.
<br />8.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are two families just above the threshold of &gt;= 14.
<br />9.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Trans - No outliers, the max raw count is 2. There is a family near the threshold of &gt;= 6 but it is just below and still only have 2 raw counts.
<br />12.3 - Allele Fraction Densities, Mosaic Child - There is a bit of a bump in the AF distributions for mosaic sibling calls. This may go away with the above filtering of families but also is likely just due to the low number of calls.</p>
