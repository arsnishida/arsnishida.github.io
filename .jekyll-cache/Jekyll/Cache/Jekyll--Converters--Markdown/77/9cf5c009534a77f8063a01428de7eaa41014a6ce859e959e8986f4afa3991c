I"E<p>Here is a list of the final SP ID’s and their family that are ultimately used in our analysis.
<br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/awrb72bkxcxgmix/final_sample_list.txt?dl=0">Final Sample List</a></p>

<p>These are the total number of families used in the analysis and where they disappear during our filtering. The first round of filtering is technical – either the variant calls failed or the family was missing a member to continue. The second round of filtering is based on the figure in this post based on read depths and variant call numbers, https://arsnishida.github.io/2021/07/26/post-0038.html.</p>
