<p>The tool, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/users/kruppd/scripts/file/joint_coverage_calc_front.py</code>, needed to be rewritten into something more flexible. It also needs to eliminate hard-coded family information since my tables are already pre-split by family. This changes it into simply looking for the overlap of sites between a sorted coverage file and the reference with bedops and takes advantage of numerical sorting of the output to make quicker counts. Here a comparison is performed attempting to regenerate the original output in both manners and checking for fidelity. Code for running is in: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/spark_mosaic/burden/test_compare/run.txt</code>.</p>

<p>The md5sums are comparable in the first check of comparing the re-use of the original tools.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The outputs are comparable below in the second check fo comparing the new tool to the old tool. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home/SPARK%20Mosaics/linked_files?preview=blog_SPARK_refseqCdsSplice_compare.png">figure-01</a></p>
