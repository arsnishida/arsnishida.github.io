I"G<p>The SSC list was transformed from hg19 to hg38 as described <a href="https://arsnishida.github.io/2021/11/30/post-0066.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>20 sites were removed for having no original FRACTION assignment. 172 sites removed for falling into a SDTRF region in going from hg19 to hg38. 9 sites were removed for having no functional mutation type (both originally and after reannotation). There were 7 mosaic child sites lost in this fashion. 1 had no mutation type in both hg19 and hg38. The other 6 fell in super duplicate regions with 3 of them being within 100 bp of each other constituting a complex event.</p>

<p>This recreates the burden analysis from the original SSC paper. The trends match but the n’s and signficance do not. 
This may be due to the</p>

<p>I looked for the list of full samples used in the SSC mosaic calls and
the list of SSC families split into LGD/NS groups. It is not clear what
was done but I attached the two best things I could find that were in
our old path: /All Files/kruppd/Writing/SSC somatic pilot/data/Data Used
for Mosaic Paper/High Confidence Variants/. Brian can confirm if these
are the correct files or not and then I’ll add them to the blog posts.
It appears the LGD/NS ID’s are by Sample and not family.
Our Dropbox accounts recently changed from Enterprise to Business
versions. All of the Dropbox links and structure should be unchanged but
let me know if something has strangely become inaccessible.</p>
