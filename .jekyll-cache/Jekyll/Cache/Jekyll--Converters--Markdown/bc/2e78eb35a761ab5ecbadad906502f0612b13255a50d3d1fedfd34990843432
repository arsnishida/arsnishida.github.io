I"õ<p>This describes the generation of the LGD and NS family lists based on the De Novo and CNV lists. Of note, there are four families combined with an underscore, â€œSF0046231_SF0068802â€ and â€œSF0113969_SF0114107â€. These are split for these lists and exist as split families in the mosaic variant lists. The LGD list includes 1157 families and the NS list includes 3933 families. Not all families are from the simple quads, simplex trios, or multiplex quad families we use in the mosaic list.</p>
