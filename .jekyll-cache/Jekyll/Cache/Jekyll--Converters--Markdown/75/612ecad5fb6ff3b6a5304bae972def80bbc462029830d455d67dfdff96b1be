I"º<p>Alt chromosomes in our hg38 and mm10 alignments, <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#downloadAlt">UCSC description</a>, cause multi-mapping in those regions. BWA flags multi-mapping reads with a MAPQ score of 0 causing them to all be lost downstream in our analysis pipeline. For most single-cell analyses we do not need to consider the alternative chromosomes and they can fall in regions of genes used as markers.</p>
