I"'<p>FINAL REPORT OF FILES:
	Nothing of my own is on lustre1, here’s the sizes of directories remaining on lustre1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/dirsizes.lustre1.nov42021.txt</code>
	The only thing copied from lustre1 was the kruppd directory. It now lives <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroakdata/lustre1_kruppd</code>
	TEMP spark files, coverages and pileups, can be deleted eventually or regenerated: /home/groups/oroakdata/TEMP_SPARK</p>

<p>There are only a few folders left on /home/exacloud/gscratch/radpantry
	but these are just scripts, programs, and empty folders I don’t have permissions to delete.
	But there’s no data and anything here can be deleted whenever.</p>
