<p>References are regenerated from ANNOVAR. Comparisons between this Annovar 2018 hg38 reference and the current 2021 reference are here showing &gt; 99% bases present in the older version relative to the newer. <a href="https://ohsu.app.box.com/file/817670565940">figure-01</a></p>

<p>Joint coverage across families were recalled with this new reference and with the small bug fixed (coverage counts are no longer off by 1).</p>

<p>Joint coverage plots were recreated separately for simplex quads, multiplex quads, and simplex trios. These count the number of bases over 52 thresholds (from the range of needing 1-250 counts) for each member of a family, the total of the family, and the average of the family.  These are subset into six regions, non-SDTRF (CDS) sites and SDTRF sites and then those are split into autosomal, X, and Y chromosomes.</p>

<p>Coverage plots are in the following markdown. There is now appropriate coverage across the exome and thresholds can be picked. <a href="https://ohsu.app.box.com/file/817670565940">figure-01</a></p>
