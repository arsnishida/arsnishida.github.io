<p>IGV shots were taken with version 2.10.3. The update to the version and subsequent change to the creation of sessions and batch scripts is due to the use of CRAMs. Shots were made of all sites in the high confident call for all three lists (simplex quad, simplex trio, multiplex quad). Simplex trio shots include four tracks. This last real track comes from a random simplex quad family which can function as an additional reference for looking at sequencing error in the area.</p>

<p>trios have bonus sibling from other family</p>

<p>not sure what this accomplishes (why thereâ€™s no burden in probands relative to siblings)
processed similarly
not sure 
not pay attention to the previous findings or if we do to use a subset of the data
	that if we filtered any of the low AF counts out what results weâ€™d get</p>
