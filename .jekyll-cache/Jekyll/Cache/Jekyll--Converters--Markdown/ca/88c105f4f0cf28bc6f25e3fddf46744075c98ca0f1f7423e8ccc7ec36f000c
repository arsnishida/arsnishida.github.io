I"z	<p><strong>TSS enrichment at a single cell level:</strong>
<br />Calculated as the ratio of signal to noise. Signal is defined as the region around TSS +/- 100bp. Noise is defined as the 100bp regions +/- 2000bp from TSS regions that do no overlap with signal. This leads signal and noise being slightly different in size but reads are uniquely counted into a single bin versus other methods where a read can fall into multiple TSS and noise regions. Output is a two-column value file.

<p><strong>TSS enrichment at bulk level, ENCODE:</strong>
<br />Calculated via ENCODE standards, <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/#enrichment">ENCODE ENRICHMENT</a>

<p>TSS bulk calculation starts with a bam2bed conversion and is potentially intensive depending on the size of the BAM. A parallelizable version of the bulk TSS calculation can be performed on exacloud.</p>

<p><strong>TSS enrichment at bulk level, inflated:</strong>
<br />This uses a larger distance from TSS sites, larger bins combining more reads, and chooses highest positions via, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.087585v1">this article</a>

<p><strong>TSS sites are gathered from ENSEMBL and are curated as such:</strong>

<p><strong>Independent FRIP caller:</strong>
<br />This FRIP calculation is divorced from scitools atac_count and is slightly more accurate. The existing FRIP calculation that occurs during matrix generation double-counts reads that overlap multiple peaks.
