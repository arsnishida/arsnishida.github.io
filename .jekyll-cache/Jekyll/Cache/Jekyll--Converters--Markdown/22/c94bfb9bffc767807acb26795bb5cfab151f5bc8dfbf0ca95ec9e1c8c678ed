I"º<p><em>Update Oct 13</em>
<em>Update Oct 12</em>. The following was changed and this completely replaces the older results. Here are the main differences.
<br />- A big issue I had was that I had empty placeholder values for siblings for the trios that shouldnâ€™t have been used in the statistical test. These are easily removed. The pvals were ultimately insignificant in all iterations so it doesnâ€™t change any of our interpretations.
<br />- The summary of nâ€™s now splits the family counts by proband and sibling. This is only relevant for trios.
<br />- Plotting of the SNVâ€™s per Exome Base is now no longer additive but uses the average rates. This makes the plots look more reasonable and the y-axis closer to expectations.
<br />- SNVâ€™s per Exome Base is now calculated as (# counts / 2*autosomal_bases_covered). I wasnâ€™t use the 2 before. This doesnâ€™t affect the test because it is ranked, it just changes the axisâ€™ magnitude.</p>
