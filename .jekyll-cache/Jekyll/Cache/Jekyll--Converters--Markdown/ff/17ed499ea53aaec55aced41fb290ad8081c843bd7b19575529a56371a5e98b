I"<p>This is the burden analysis using just the simplex quad burden table. I included the 45x/15%, 50/12.5%, and 65/10% thresholds. We probably wonâ€™t use the 65/10% threshold but I thought it helped with just plotting the figures out for perspective for now. The same two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test is performed and finds no evidence of burden.</p>

<p>Notes per section:
<br />6.3 - Print Table of Wilcoxon Rank Sums - These are the Wilcoxon rank sum test p-values. None of them are significant at 0.05.
<br />6.5 - Barplot SNV Counts, Normalized Mosaic Child per Functions - This is meant to match Figure 2 from the Krupp paper.</p>
