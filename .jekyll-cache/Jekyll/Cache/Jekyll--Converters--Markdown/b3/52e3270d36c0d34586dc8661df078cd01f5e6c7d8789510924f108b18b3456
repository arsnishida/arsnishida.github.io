<p>Joint coverage plots were created separately for simplex quads, multiplex quads, and simplex trios. These count the number of bases over 52 thresholds (from the range of needing 1-250 counts) for each member of a family, the total of the family, and the average of the family. These are subset into six regions, non-SDTRF (CDS) sites and SDTRF sites and then those are split into autosomal, X, and Y chromosomes.</p>

<p>Originally, the following joint coverage minimums were used.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>5%	130x
7.5%	85x
10%	65x
12.5%	50x
15%	45x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Coverage plots are in the following markdown. At a threshold of 5x coverage still only less than half of the bases are covered. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home/SPARK%20Mosaics/markdowns?preview=burden_coverage_plots.html">figure-01</a></p>
