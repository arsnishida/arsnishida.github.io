I"0<p>This markdown takes the pre-filtered data and plots out the metrics that are used for scoring by the logistic model. All variants are plotted and then just the subset of mosaic child calls.</p>

<p>This data represents the simplex quads only. It uses the broad filter and removes parental germline calls.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A broad filter to reduce computational load is used.
- Frequent variants appearing 5 or more times are removed from further analysis.
- Common variant allele frequencies determined from ExAC and gnomAD annotations must be less than 0.005.
- Variants require at least 3 non-reference reads and at least 8 reads in all four family members.
- Variants must also fall within exonic or splicing regions from RefSeq annotations.
