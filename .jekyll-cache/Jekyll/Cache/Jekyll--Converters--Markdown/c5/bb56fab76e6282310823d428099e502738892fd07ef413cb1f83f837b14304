<p>The data is first filtered with loose criteria that will not be changed: there must be 8 reads at the location for the samples, the population allele frequencies must be less than 0.001, the variant is called less than four times across the families in the list, it must have at least 3 variant reads, and it must have an exonic refseq annotation. The data is then filtered again with stricter criteria (testfilter). These criteria were developed for the older lists, might not be as appropriate for these lists, and may change eventually. These stricter criteria are: five variant reads, greater than 0.03 AF, called by at least two callers (mpup, lofreq, or varscan), has an upper 90% confidence intervals via Agresti-Coull method above or equal to 5%, MISMATCH_XM_ALT_MEDIAN &lt;= 3, and SCORE_400_RB3 &gt; 0.518. I then filtered it down to toss out the numerous germline parental calls that won’t be of use to us for looking at mosaics. The data here is unlikely to change but will certainly get filtered down further in the future.</p>

<p>Currently, the three lists were made and looked at completely separate from each other. So columns like “NUM_FAMILY_FOUND” will only count up families where the variant is found within the one list and not across all three lists.</p>

<p>All columns are the same across the three lists. The trio list has “NAs” for the columns referencing the ‘sib’ family member. For the multiplex list, know that Spark labels usually use the convention of ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘proband’, and ‘sibling’ but a few families are labeled differently – either with multiple probands, multiple siblings, or “half_sibling” or other labels. In these cases, I continue to use the column names for PRO and SIB in my list even if a family has two samples labeled “SIB”. The exact sample in question will be in the Sample field.</p>

<p>The categories (FRACTION column) we group into are: GERMLINE_CHILD, MOSAIC_CHILD, MOSAIC_PARENTAL_NONTRANS, MOSAIC_PARENTAL_TRANS, GERMLINE_CONFLICT, MOSAIC_CHILD_WITH_PARENTAL_CONFLICT, MOSAIC_PARENTAL_WITH_TRANS_CONFLICT, and MULTI_MOSAIC. The “MULTI_MOSAIC” and “CONFLICT” groups will probably be entirely ignored going forward. They indicate that a putative mosaic was found but the variant’s presence or absence in the other members of the family is not resolved or conflating.</p>

<p>“SCORE_400_RB3” is probably our best column for the time being to use for sorting mosaics by which have the best support.</p>

<p>Here are descriptions of all the columns in the table:
<br />1/CHR, 2/START, 3/STOP, 4/REF, 5/ALT - general variant information
<br />6/FAMILY, 7/SAMPLE, 8/FRACTION - SF family ID, SP sample ID, putative mosaic annotation
<br />9/DP_MAIN, 10/DPALT_MAIN, 11/AF_MAIN - the depth of reads, depth of alt reads, and AF for the main person of the family
<br />12/LOFREQ_STATS_NAMES, 13/LOFREQ_STATS, 14/MPUP_STATS_NAMES, 15/MPUP_STATS, 16/VARSCAN_STATS_NAMES, 17/VARSCAN_STATS - stats from the three variant callers with their descriptor fields
<br />18/MISMATCH_REF_READS, 19/MISMATCH_ALT_READS, 20/MISMATCH_OTHER_READS, 21/MISMATCH_SPAN_DELS, 22/MISMATCH_MAPQ_REF_MEAN, 23/MISMATCH_MAPQ_ALT_MEAN, 24/MISMATCH_MAPQ_OTHER_MEAN, 25/MISMATCH_MAPQ_REF_MEDIAN, 26/MISMATCH_MAPQ_ALT_MEDIAN, 27/MISMATCH_MAPQ_OTHER_MEDIAN, 28/MISMATCH_MAPQ_REF_MODE, 29/MISMATCH_MAPQ_ALT_MODE, 30/MISMATCH_MAPQ_OTHER_MODE, 31/MISMATCH_XM_REF_MEAN, 32/MISMATCH_XM_ALT_MEAN, 33/MISMATCH_XM_OTHER_MEAN, 34/MISMATCH_XM_REF_MEDIAN, 35/MISMATCH_XM_ALT_MEDIAN, 36/MISMATCH_XM_OTHER_MEDIAN, 37/MISMATCH_XM_REF_MODE, 38/MISMATCH_XM_ALT_MODE, 39/MISMATCH_XM_OTHER_MODE - large collection of stats concerning mismatches across the region, only MISMATCH_XM_ALT_MEDIAN gets used downstream for another derived column
<br />40/DP_FA, 41/DP_MO, 42/DP_PRO, 43/DP_SIB, 44/DPALT_FA, 45/DPALT_MO, 46/DPALT_PRO, 47/DPALT_SIB - depths across all family members

<br />50/ERROR_VAR, 51/ERROR_ALL, 52/ERROR_VARMAX, 53/ERROR_RATE - error in the region calculated over a random subset of 1000 samples, only rate gets used downstream for another derived column
<br />54/NUM_FAMILY_FOUND - number of families the variant is found before filtering
<br />55/PHET_FA, 56/PHET_MO, 57/PHET_PRO, 58/PHET_SIB - pvalue of exact test given the depth and the depth of the alt read in each family member testing if it is less than 0.5 (heterogeneous)
<br />59/PERSON - identity of the person
<br />60/DPALT_BIN - binary column derived from DPALT_MAIN used for SCORE_400_RB3
<br />61/ERROR_BIN_3 - categorical column (low, medium, high) derived from ERROR_RATE used for SCORE_400_RB3
<br />62/AF_BIN_3 - categorical column (low, medium, high) derived from AF_MAIN used for SCORE_400_RB3
<br />63/REF_CG - categorical column (C or G) derived from REF used for SCORE_400_RB3
<br />64/XM_ALT_1 - binary column derived from MISMATCH_XM_ALT_MEDIAN used for SCORE_400_RB3
<br />65/SCORE_400_RB3 - score from logistic regression model that takes into account many of the other columns
<br />66/genomicSuperDupes, 67/rmsk, 68/simpleRepeat, 69/mutationType, 70/exonicAnnotation, 71/variantFunctionType, 72/variantFunctionGene - annotations with annovar-2018-06-15
<br />73/filteredCohortCount - number of families the variant is found after preliminary filtering

<br />76/FRACTION_ORIGINAL - old, erroneous annotations of the site for posterity, see May 9 update
<br />77/FRACTION_MORE - a subset of column 8, FRACTION, with further granularity, see June 3 update
<br />78/PSAME_FAxPRO, 79/PSAME_FAxSIB, 80/PSAME_MOxPRO, 81/PSAME_MOxSIB - Fisher’s exact test comparing depths and alt reads from parents versus children for the purposes of testing a transmission event.</p>

<p>*Update for June 3, 2021</p>

<p>Tables are modified for June 3. I added five new columns. The PSAME columns and the FRACTION_MORE column. FRACTION_MORE is derived here: https://arsnishida.github.io/2021/06/03/post-0019.html.</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>*Update for May 9, 2021</p>

<p>Tables are modified for May 9. I updated the “FRACTION” annotation column adjusting an error in the later files. There is one new column at the end called, “FRACTION_ORIGINAL”. This contains the first call of the fraction that should be ignored but I’m keeping it in the file as a record.</p>
