I"À<p>This compares our high confidence mosaic lists to the SPARK DNV lists.
This shows that nearly all of our germline calls are called in their list (2588/2661 = 97%).
The Venn shows there are still many germline calls we are not picking but this isnâ€™t a surprise because we subject everything to harsher filtering while looking for mosaics.
A large number of mosaics we call (145/352 = 41%) are flagged as de novo variants in the SPARK list.</p>
