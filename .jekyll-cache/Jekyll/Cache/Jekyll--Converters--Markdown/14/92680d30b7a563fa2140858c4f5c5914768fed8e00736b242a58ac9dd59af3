I"¾<p>The SSC list was transformed from hg19 to hg38.</p>

<p>VEP was used to annotate the high confidence lists. The following databases were used. There are redundant scores between the databases but they might possibly differ slightly due to the different versions of references each uses.</p>
<ul>
  <li>dbNSFP v4.1a from ftp://dbnsfp:dbnsfp@dbnsfp.softgenetics.com/dbNSFP4.1a.zip</li>
  <li>gnomAD v3.0.1 from https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-public-dataâ€“gnomad/release/3.0.1/coverage/genomes/gnomad.genomes.r3.0.1.coverage.summary.tsv.bgz</li>
  <li>REVEL v1.3 from https://sites.google.com/site/revelgenomics/downloads</li>
  <li>LoFtool scores (no version) from https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins</li>
  <li>ExACpLI scores (no version) from https://github.com/Ensembl/VEP_plugins</li>
  <li>blosum62 scores (no version)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am keeping this separated from the high confidence lists but these columns can be directly added to the highconfidence lists without any reordering (the rows are the same). These are available here.

<p>The dbNSFP columns are described here and then are followed by the other scores from the other annotation databases:
