I"l<p>This is the burden analysis using just the simplex quad burden table. I included the 45x/15%, 50/12.5%, and 65/10% thresholds. We probably wonâ€™t use the 65/10% threshold but I thought it helped with just plotting the figures out for perspective for now. The same two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test is performed and finds no evidence of burden.</p>
