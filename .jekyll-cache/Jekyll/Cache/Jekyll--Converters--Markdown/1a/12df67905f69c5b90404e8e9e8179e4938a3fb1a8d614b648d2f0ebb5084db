I"#<p>This is a second pass through the data. This is a redo of parts 1, 2, and 2b with coverages coming from joint coverages (entire family, parents, and children). This is just on the quad simplex files.</p>

<p>The first markdown includes how the data was loaded, filtered, and subset and has no plots. The second markdown contains the plots.</p>

<p>Notes per section from 4b:
<br />4.5 - Decile Plots of Joint Coverage by Family - There is a bit more of a tail than by individual.
<br />4.6/4.7 - Decile Plots of Joint Parent/Child Coverage by Family - The tails are more observable in these.
<br />5.2 - Plot Genomic Coverage, Autosomal - Here is the comparison of joint coverage distributions alongside individual coverages. Joint coverage takes families into the 25-50% range whereas individuals are in the 50-75% range.
<br />6.2 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child - There is the single outlier family/person with 9 counts.
<br />7.2 and 7.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child - There is a slight outlier family/person but it doesnâ€™t show up as much in 7.3.
<br />8.2 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child - There is the single outlier family/person with 9 counts.
<br />9.2 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child - There is the single outlier family/person with 9 counts.</p>
