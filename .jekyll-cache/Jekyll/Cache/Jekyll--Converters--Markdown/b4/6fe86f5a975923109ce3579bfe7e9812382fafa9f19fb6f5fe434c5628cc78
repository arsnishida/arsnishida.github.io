<p>Notes per section from 4b:
<br />4.5 - Decile Plots of Joint Coverage by Family - There is a bit more of a tail than by individual.
<br />4.6/4.7 - Decile Plots of Joint Parent/Child Coverage by Family - The tails are more observable in these.
<br />5.2 - Plot Genomic Coverage, Autosomal - Here is the comparison of joint coverage distributions alongside individual coverages. Joint coverage takes families into the 25-50% range whereas individuals are in the 50-75% range.
<br />6.2 and 6.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Child - There is the single outlier proband with 9 counts.
<br />7.2 and 7.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Germline Child - There is a slight outlier sibling but it doesnâ€™t show up as much in the adjusted plots in 7.3.
<br />8.2 and 8.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There is a bit of a tail in the maternal calls with few outliers that are still high even in the adjusted plots.
<br />9.2 and 9.3 - Plot SNV Counts, Mosaic Parental Trans - All the counts seem relatively low with no outliers but the members with 2 counts do also have lower coverage and they remain high in the adjusted plots.</p>
