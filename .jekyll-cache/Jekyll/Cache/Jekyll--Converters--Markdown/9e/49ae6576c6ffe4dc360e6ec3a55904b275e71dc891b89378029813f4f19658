I"Y<p>This compares our high confidence mosaic lists to the SPARK DNV lists. This shows that nearly all of our germline calls are called in their list (2588/2661 = 97%). The Venn shows there are still many germline calls we are not picking but this isn’t a surprise because we subject everything to harsher filtering while looking for mosaics. A large number of mosaics we call (145/352 = 41%) are flagged as de novo variants in the SPARK list. Boxplots, densities, and histograms of allele frequencies show that these are at intermediate AF’s.</p>

<p>Notes:
<br />5.3 - Their DNV Calls Flagged as Mosaic Child in Our List - This shows their DNV calls that we call as mosaic are of expected higher AF.
<br />5.4 - Their DNV Calls Flagged as Germline Child in Our List - This shows the Germline calls that make uniquely are at lower read depth.
<br />5.5 - Combined Boxplot of AF’s - This is a more complete and non-overlapping way of looking at the AF distributions across all partitions.
<br />6.2 - Densities with All 4 Groups - density plots of AF’s
<br />6.3 - Hists with All 4 Groups - hists of AF’s
<br />6.4 - Densities with 3 Relevant Groups - same as above but without germline calls specific to our list
<br />6.5 - Hists with 3 Relevant Groups - same as above but without germline calls specific to our list</p>
