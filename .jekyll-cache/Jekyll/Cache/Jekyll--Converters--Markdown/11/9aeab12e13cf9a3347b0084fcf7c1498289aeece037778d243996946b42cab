<p>This is an example rough pass through analyzing the results of the DA test. This focuses on the ‘3_Parent_d5’ comparisons as the example. Clusters are combined across treatments but kept separate. Thresholds for ‘significantly changing’ sites are &lt; 0.01 raw p-value and &gt; 1.5 Log2 FC. The significant results could be annotated by their motifs and nearest genes.</p>

<p>5.2-5.7 - P-value distributions are left-skewed. FDR does not work except maybe with WT_to_KI_KI. Volcano plots suggest global opening and closing in some conditions (WT_to_KI_KI shows a global decrease in accessibility across many sites).
8.8 - Heatmap shows groups of sites that are specific to the strains trending in the same direction. The most notable is the group for WT to KI_KI which shows large decreases specific to the biological cluster 3 (in yellow on the left).</p>
