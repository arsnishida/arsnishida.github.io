<p>Ryan made a first pass through this data written up on <a href="https://mulqueenr.github.io/tbr1/">his blog</a>. I used his annotations and kept the old TSS enrichments (ArchR calculates its own internally). He made these after filtering so not all of the cells in the current ArchR project will have entries but these cells are confidently going to be filtered out. I went through ArchR up to about part 6 in the ArchR full manual. I made a broad first pass to get everything recorded, added Ryan‚Äôs existing stuff, plotted the metrics, filtered, and then did the dimensionality reduction and clustering. Then after the lab meeting I went and played around the filtering and iterative LSI options.</p>

<p>General metrics show low TSS enrichment and higher fragment sizes. ‚ÄúThe bump around 200 is tagmentation on either side of a nucleosome (they are about 185bp) below that is subnucleosomal, which can be a sign of over-tagmentation or poor chromatin structure. The linker region between nucleosome is 11-80ish no but usually on the much smaller size so you don‚Äôt expect two tagmentation events between nucleosomes. I think in this case it is reflecting nucleosomes falling apart/off DNA.‚Äù -Ryan <a href="https://ohsu.app.box.com/file/808812070910">figure-01</a></p>

<p>With module R/4.0.4 this little bit will let you load up the current ArchR project for yourself:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># library, resource ArchR
library(presto)
library(ArchR)

# set env
addArchRGenome("mm10")
set.seed(25)

# reload the previous project
proj &lt;- loadArchRProject(path = "/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/sc_tmp1/ArchROutput/")
</code></pre></div></div>
