I"ù<p>The SSC variant calls are taken from this Box file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://ohsu.box.com/s/dqm3garunt0xobvgdz41onpexi87yqin</code>, on this path, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">All Files/kruppd/Writing/SSC somatic pilot/data/Data Used for Mosaic Paper/High Confidence Variants/HighConfidence Variants Collapsed_2.csv</code>. This appears to be a similar version of Table S5 from the Krupp 2017 paper with the columns with the statistics which are excluded from the paper. Unlike the table in the paper, this also collapses sites in overlapping genes into a single entry which is more in line with the SPARK lists where genes are combined in one entry separated by commas. All SSC columns are transformed to match the columns for the SPARK list.</p>

<p>Here is the transformed SSC list. It has the same columns but with extra columns representing the SSC specific entries. These can be ignored except for maybe the first additional column, column 88, which is whether it comes from a QUAD or TRIO family.</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>The following column is added at the end for filtering:
	Filter out variants where this is no FRACTION call made.
	Filter out variants falling in non-exonic regions, super duplicate regions, or trfs.
	Filter out variants without a functional mutation type.</p>

<p>The following columns were changed:
	Coordinates were changed via LiftOver with 100% of the sites found going from hg19 to hg38.
	All genomic and functional annotations are redone with annovar for hg38.
	FRACTION_MORE is derived from FRACTION with name changes to match the SPARK list (‚ÄúGERMLINE_C‚Äù to ‚ÄúGERMLINE_CHILD‚Äù).
	ACC_DIST and DON_DIST are the same value. The SSC list only kept the closest and the SPARK list keeps both.
	COMPLEX_EVENT is binary in the SPARK list and descriptive in the SSC list.
	NUM_FAMILY_FOUND and filteredCohortCount represent counts before filtering and after filtering in the SPARK list. Only the final count is kept in the SSC list.
	HGNCsymbol_to_ENSID and RefSeq_to_ENSID are the ENSEMBL ID‚Äôs determined from hg38 annotations.</p>

<p>The following columns were dropped and all set to ‚ÄòNA‚Äô:
	There are no numerical sample IDs in the SSC list.
	SSC uses combined family stats from the variant callers wheras the SPARK list keeps them by individual so these are dropped.
	Mismatch stats for raw mismatch counts, ‚Äòother‚Äô read counts, and the means are not present in the SSC list.
	gnomAD allele fractions are not present in the earlier SSC table.
	The only error columns in the SSC list are the calculated rates.
	FRACTION_OLD are all ‚ÄòNA‚Äôs. This represent old and wrong FRACTION calls from the original SPARK list that wouldn‚Äôt be made for the SSC list.
	The splice site transcript IDs are not present, just the distances.</p>

<p>OLD:
The following SSC specific column was kept and added at the end. This might be important for analysis:
	TYPE - TRIO or QUAD
	SEGDUP, RMSK, TRF, FUNC_TYPE, TRANS_REF, CLASS_REF, GENE_REF</p>

<p>The following SSC specific columns were kept and added at the end. These can likely be ignored. I‚Äôve tried to describe them as best as possible without knowing their exact provenance:
	STUDY - COHORT or PILOT24 or PILOT400
	PUBLISHED - IOSSIFOV_2014 or KRUMM_2015
	AF_ESP, AF_1KG - allele fractions from other databases
	PCTILE_CDS_AUTO_45X - 5% percentiles of CDS AUTO 45x
	FORMAT_VARSCAN, FORMAT_LOFREQ, FORMAT_SMOC, VARSCAN_232_FA, LOFREQ_211_FA, SMOC_FA, VARSCAN_232_MO, LOFREQ_211_MO, SMOC_MO, VARSCAN_232_PRO, LOFREQ_211_PRO, SMOC_PRO, VARSCAN_232_SIB, LOFREQ_211_SIB, SMOC_SIB - family-based variant calling output
	DIST_TO_PREV, DIST_TO_NEXT, PERSON_PREV, PERSON_NEXT - closest call and person	
	QC_STATUS - at this stage they are all ‚ÄòPASS‚Äô, unknown criteria
	COHORT_DP, COHORT_DPALT, P400_COUNT_MOS, P400_COUNT_GERM, COHORT_COUNT_MOS, COHORT_COUNT_GERM, COHORT_MAX_AD, P400_COUNT_ALL - various counts within the cohort subsets
	AF_FA, AF_MO, AF_PRO, AF_SIB, CALLED_FA, CALLED_MO, CALLED_PRO, CALLED_SIB, DETECT_FA, DETECT_MO, DETECT_PRO, DETECT_SIB, PHET_MAIN, SITE_KEY, PARENTAL, GONADAL, CALLED_VARSCAN, CALLED_LOFREQ, CALLED_SMOC - these are all redundant derived columns</p>
