<p>These are the results from comparing all the clusters against one another to look for differentially accessible peaks. I performed a term factor transformation to adjust for depth and compared cells by pheograph cluster annotation via the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Peaks are annotated to their nearest gene and p-values are corrected with an FDR correction.</p>

<p>The FDR correction does not work on this dataset. There are +1M peaks but peaks with p-values of &lt; 0.01 are usually in the few hundreds or lower. The FDR correction ends up setting everything to 1. For now, just use the regular p-values. Probably start it at a threshold of 0.01 but you can move it up to 0.05 or even higher if desirable. I left the files with the FDR column in there with the suffix FDR but they wonâ€™t be of use.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an example of how Iâ€™d start parsing through the data. This example would show you the nearby genes that have statistically different peaks between pg_10 and pg_11.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># open the file, filter for peaks with a pvalue &lt; 0.01, filter for peaks +/- 10000bp to a TSS, pull out gene names, sort, print unique results
# move the thresholds as desired
cat DA_pg.pg_10_pg_11.txt | awk '$7 &lt; 0.01' | awk '$10 &lt; 10000 &amp;&amp; $10 &gt; -10000' | cut -f 9 | sort | uniq
</code></pre></div></div>
