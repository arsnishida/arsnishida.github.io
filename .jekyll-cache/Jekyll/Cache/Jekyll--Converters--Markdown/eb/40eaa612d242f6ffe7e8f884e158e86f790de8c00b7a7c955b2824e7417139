I"ã<p>Here is a rough, first pass processing pipeline for sc-RNAseq. In general, it works by turning the FASTQ into a BAM and adding the barcodes, UMIs, alignment, and annotation to that BAM. The purpose is creating a complete BAM that can then be filtered, de-duped, and counted on the fly. This means there‚Äôs only one single BAM with all the information and one can pull out what they need from it without having to go back steps. The broad steps are adapted from the following pipeline: https://github.com/epigen/scifiRNA-seq.</p>

<p>Here are some issues with the technical side of the pipeline.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The barcodes are saved in the BC tag and the UMIs are saved in the XU tag. These are appropriate, standardized tags but there are various other standardized tags that conceivably these can go under.</li>
  <li>Deduplication technically does what it is supposed to do, it looks at the combination of barcode+umi+annotatedGene and keeps only unique results. It is written in with just bash sort and uniq commands parsing the BAM. This is a nice shortcut but it is likely we will want to save an entirely new BAM for the purposes of visualization.</li>
  <li>In this one test pass I am not filtering for alignment quality but this would be simple to add in with the samtools view command.</li>
  <li>I ran deduplication with scitools rmdup and picard MarkDuplicates. There is a part of me that thinks scitools rmdup should just work for this but I would need to dig into why or why not more specifically. To get picard MarkDuplicates to be barcode and UMI aware I believe we would need to make a new tag that combines the two together. It‚Äôs worth testing this out and comparing but the existing solution works for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some metrics with the output which might identify some problems. In general, the amount of usable data at the end seems too low but I also don‚Äôt know all the expectations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uniquely aligning reads is high at ~80%</li>
  <li>The number of reads that were even annotated was low. ~10M reads which is ~18% of the total. This includes every read too so also multi-mapping reads. The annotation currently does not include rRNA which might be where all the reads are going?</li>
  <li>The number of annotated, uniquely mapping, and deduplicated reads is similarly low at less than 1 million reads.

<p>And here is a shot of the data gone through dimensionality reduction with cistopics. There‚Äôs structure but a lot of messy, diverse clusters. I think the messiness makes sense given the extra sparseness of the matrix.
