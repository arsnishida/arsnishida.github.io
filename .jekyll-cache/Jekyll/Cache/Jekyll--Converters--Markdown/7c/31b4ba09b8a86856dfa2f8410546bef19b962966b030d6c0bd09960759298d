<p>ChromVAR was run with R v4.0.0 using the JASPAR 2020 motif database for mm10. This was performed on the data filtered at the TSS 1.5 threshold.</p>

<p>Here are the variabilities plotted in order where the motifs are slightly different from the 1.5 thresholded version: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kcz824kl28c21wc/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_variability.png?dl=0">Variability FIgure</a></p>

<p>Motifs like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jdm5st6kcjttic/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_NEUROD1.png?dl=0">NEUROD1 (Deviations UMAP)</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9plgj38wfd0cb1b/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_LHX9.png?dl=0">LHX9 (Deviations UMAP)</a> remain top hits with similar distributions as the 2.7 versions.</p>

<p>We get enrichment of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/af88qnznirb5iya/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_KLF9.png?dl=0">KLF9 (Deviations UMAP)</a> motifs as well but it follows the same distribution of motifs like  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ap8ek6p7ecw4c0/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_CTCF.png?dl=0">CTCF (Deviations UMAP)</a>. These show enrichment in the high TSS enriched cells relative to low TSS enriched cells so Iâ€™m not convinced these are representative of anything interesting. We would really want to find a motif with the opposite distribution (high enrichment for a motif in the low TSS cells and low motif enrichment in the high TSS cells) to say those lower TSS cells had something worthwhile.</p>
