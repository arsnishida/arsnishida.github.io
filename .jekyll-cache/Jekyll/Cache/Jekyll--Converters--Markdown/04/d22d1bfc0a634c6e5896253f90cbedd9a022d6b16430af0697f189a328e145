I"<p><em>Update Oct 13</em>. Updated to add 0 counts for families with absent calls.</p>

<p>This is an extension of the burden analysis but here we are keeping only damaging missense calls by thresholding on REVEL scores &gt;= 0.50. This eliminates many of the calls but does produce a stronger signal in comparing probands to siblings. REVEL scores are available in the supplmental annotation folder.</p>
