I"U<p>Alt chromosomes in our hg38 and mm10 alignments (<a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQdownloads.html#downloadAlt">UCSC description</a>) cause multi-mapping in those regions. BWA flags multi-mapping reads with a MAPQ score of 0 causing them to all be lost downstream in our analysis pipeline. For most single-cell analyses we do not need to consider the alternative chromosomes and they can fall in regions of genes used as markers. Here they are replaced with new genome builds. See <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/refs/hg38/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/retrieval.txt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/refs/mm10/GCA_000001635.5_GRCm38.p3_no_alt_analysis_set/retrieval.txt</code> for origins of FASTA files. Indexes for BWA were recalled with v0.7.15-r1140.</p>
