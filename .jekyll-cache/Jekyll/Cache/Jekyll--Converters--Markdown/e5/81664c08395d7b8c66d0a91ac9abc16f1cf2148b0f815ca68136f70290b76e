I"/<p>This is the gene set burden analysis using just the simplex quad burden table. We probably wonâ€™t use the 65/10% threshold but I thought it helped with just plotting the figures out for perspective for now. The same two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test is performed and finds no evidence of burden.</p>
