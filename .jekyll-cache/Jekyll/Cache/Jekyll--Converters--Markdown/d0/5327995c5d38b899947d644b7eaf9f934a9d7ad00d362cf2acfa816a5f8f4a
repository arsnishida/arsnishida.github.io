I"<p>This combines the three high confidence lists to reasses cohort counts and compare them all in totality against the DNV list.</p>

<p>There are five variant sites appearing in three different families when combining all the three lists together. The full comparison to the DNV list shows the same trends in the simplex quad only comparison. 97% of our Germline Child calls are found in their DNV list.</p>

<p>Notes per section:
<br />5.2 - Recount Cohort Counts, Plot - Histogram showing the re-counted, final cohort counts after combining the lists. There are very few sites appearing more than once.
<br />5.3 - Recount Cohort Counts, List Counts - Table of counts. There are five variants called at the same place in three different families across the three lists.
<br />7.1 - Their DNV Calls Flagged as Mosaic Child in Our List - Nearly half of our mosaic calls are called in the DNV list. These are expectingly higher in AF relative to all of the calls.
<br />7.2 - Their DNV Calls Flagged as Germline Child in Our List - We find 97% of our Germline Child calls in the DNV list. The ones we donâ€™t find have mildly less depth.</p>
