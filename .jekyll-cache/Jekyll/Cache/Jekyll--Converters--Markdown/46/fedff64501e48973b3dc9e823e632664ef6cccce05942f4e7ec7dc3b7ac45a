<p>Here are some of the UMAPs and how they were plot in 3d.
<br /><a href="">UMAP in 3D w/ TSS Enrichment</a>
<br /><a href="">UMAP in 3D w/ Pseudotime</a>
<br /><a href="">UMAP in 3D w/ Bio Cluster</a>
<br /><a href="">UMAP in 3D w/ Treatment</a></p>

<p>This markdown contains two parts for various figures. The first part shows the DA results from comparing pg 1 and pg 12 in the data filtered at TSS &gt; 1.5. The second part contains a comparison of the results from running ChromVAR on the two TSS &gt; 1.5 and 2.7 datasets.</p>

<p>Markdown Notes:
<br />1.2 - Plot PVALS - These are terribly skewed suggesting the test itself is not a good choice.
<br />1.3 - Plot FDRS - These end up all as 1 due to the issue above.
<br />2.3 - Plot Variability, Spearman - The overall variabilities are well correlated with a few outliers from the KLF family.
<br />2.4 - Show KLF9 and CTCF Score Correlations - The deviation scores from ChromVAR run on the TSS &gt; 1.5 dataset are compared for KLF9 and CTCF. KLF9 is a variable motif under the 1.5 dataset but not the 2.7 dataset. It has a similar pattern and distribution to CTCF but this show the scores aren’t well correlated suggesting it isn’t simply an indication of quality like CTCF usually indicates.</p>
