I"÷<p>I have ~50 or so families that need to be redone in the multiplex quad lists which will require regeneration of those lists for both WES2 and WES3. There were two main issues. The first was that SPARK provides a sample file and a family file and there are contradictions between these two files. The second was that the family structures of some multiplex families becomes overly complex. I programatically tried to create the order of samples of FATHER, MOTHER, PROBAND, SIBLING but these more complex families require hand-annotation. This ends up being a problematic bug since there is no technical failure of any of the jobs but they end up in the wrong order and position so it wasnâ€™t apparent that these were wrong until inspection at the end.</p>
