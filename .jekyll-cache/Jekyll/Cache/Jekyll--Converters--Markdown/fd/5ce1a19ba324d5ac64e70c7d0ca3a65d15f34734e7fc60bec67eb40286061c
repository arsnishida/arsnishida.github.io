I"'<p>The SSC variant calls are taken from this Box file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://ohsu.box.com/s/dqm3garunt0xobvgdz41onpexi87yqin</code>, on this path, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">All Files/kruppd/Writing/SSC somatic pilot/data/Data Used for Mosaic Paper/High Confidence Variants/HighConfidence Variants Collapsed_2.csv</code>. This appears to be a similar version of Table S5 from the Krupp 2017 paper with the columns with the statistics which are excluded from the paper. Unlike the table in the paper, this also collapses sites in overlapping genes into a single entry which is more in line with the SPARK lists where genes are combined in one entry separated by commas. All SSC columns are transformed to match the columns for the SPARK list.</p>
