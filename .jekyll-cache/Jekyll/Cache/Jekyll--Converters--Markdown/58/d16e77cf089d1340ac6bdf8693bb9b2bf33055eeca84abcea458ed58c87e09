I"]<p><strong>TSS enrichment at a single cell level:</strong>
<br />Calculated as the ratio of signal to noise. Signal is defined as the region around TSS +/- 100bp. Noise is defined as the 100bp regions +/- 2000bp from TSS regions that do no overlap with signal. This leads signal and noise being slightly different in size but reads are uniquely counted into a single bin versus other methods where a read can fall into multiple TSS and noise regions. Output is a two-column value file.
