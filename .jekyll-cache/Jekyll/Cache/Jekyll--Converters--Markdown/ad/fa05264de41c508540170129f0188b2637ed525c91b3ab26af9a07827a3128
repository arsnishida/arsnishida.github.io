These are all copies of scripts, software, or empty folders that I do not have permissions to delete. There is no data and anything remaining can be deleted whenever.</p>

<p>None of my files exist on lustre1. Here are the sizes of directories remaining on lustre1: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/dirsizes.lustre1.nov42021.txt</code>.</p>

<p>The only directory copied from lustre1 waas the kruppd directory which is copied here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroakdata/lustre1_kruppd</code>.</p>

<p>Interemediate SPARK mosaic files, mpileups and GATK coverages, are here.</p>

<p>These can be deleted for space and can always be regenerated from the CRAMs.</p>

<p>The WES1 locations are here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroakdata/TEMP_SPARK</code>.</p>

<p>The WES2/3 locations are here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/spark_mosaic/TEMP/</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>libraries environments could be deleted whenever, if anybody happens to be using my libraries or environments they should move them or recreate them in their own space.
unwritten:</li>
  <li>plasmid? - abandoned</li>
  <li>paternity - check with hadley with the final summary; fixed the sample mixups; gone from slack history, mendellian_error output, revisit what the error codes mean</li>
  <li>ntd - all zipped up by sequence date, last one was done by sally and is a copy of her directory</li>
</ul>
