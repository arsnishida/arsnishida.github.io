<br /><a href="">Preliminary Outlier Analysis for Trio Simplex Calls, part 6b</a></p>

<p>Notes per section from 6b:
<br />4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - Appears similarly to simplex quads. There isnâ€™t a tail. No filtering recommended again.
<br />5.2 - Plot Genomic Coverage, Autosomal - Also similarily expected. To note, joint family coverages here for trios are going to be larger than simplex quad family coverages since there are fewer family members.
<br />5.8 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Child - Thereâ€™s a single, clear outlier that would get filtered out with the same simplex quad threshold of &gt;= 10.
<br />6.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Germline Child - No outliers. Nothing would be removed with the same simplex quad threshold of &gt;= 12.
<br />7.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are a few clear outliers and a few ambiguous cases like in the simplex quads. 2 families are clear outliers and 5 are near the threshold but still fall above the simplex quad threshold of &gt;= 14.
<br />8.3 - Plot SNV Counts Jitter, Mosaic Parental Trans - No outliers. Nothing would be removed with the same simplex quad threshold of &gt;= 6.</p>
