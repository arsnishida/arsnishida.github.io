I"9<p>This describes a second pass at the processing pipeline for sc-RNAseq. The main changes from the first pass are the name changes to the tags and breaking the final steps into multiple parts to use the intermediate output for filtering purposes. Talking with Zach from the Saunders lab, here are some differences or elaborations we can add. Their work seems structured around DropSeq pipelines and tools related to edgeR and making DGE objects. Tag usage seems to indicate a lot being originally adapted from this <a href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/blob/master/doc/Drop-seq_Alignment_Cookbook.pdf.">link</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>built around snakemake paired with SLURM jobs</li>
  <li>uses condaenvs instead of modules	since they are on exacloud</li>
  <li>uses XC, XM, XG tags vs. the current choice of BC, XU, and XT tags</li>
  <li>performs read adapter trimming</li>
  <li>uses cellbender for background removal</li>
  <li>uses something for cell calling (using some method to choose cell filtering thresholds rather than setting arbitrary thresholds)</li>
</ul>
