I"q<p>This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup. Here I am plotting preliminary coverage figures and getting SNV counts by grouping. This is just on the quad simplex files.</p>

<p>This is similar to the previous post but with histograms instead of boxplots for SNV counting with and without families with 0 counts removed from the plots.</p>

<p>These were the filter Deidre used at one point to identify outlying families:</p>

mosaic_nontrans 45x 5%, adjusted &gt;=12 calls
germline_c      45x 5%, adjusted &gt;=12 calls
mosaic_trans    45x 5%, adjusted &gt;= 6 calls
</code></pre></div></div>

<br />4.1 - Generate Count Tables/Count Table Creation for All Variants - This takes too long in R. Just count them up outside of R.</p>
