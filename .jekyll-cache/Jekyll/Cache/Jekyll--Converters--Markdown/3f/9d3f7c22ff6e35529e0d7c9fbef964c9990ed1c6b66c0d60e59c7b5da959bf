I"4<p>There are a few folders left on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/exacloud/gscratch/radpantry</code>. These are all copies of scripts, software, or empty folders that I do not have permission to delete. There is no data in any of these however and they can be deleted whenever.</p>
