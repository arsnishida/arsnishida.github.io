<p>Notes per section:
<br />5.2 - Recount Cohort Counts, Plot - Histogram showing the re-counted, final cohort counts after combining the lists. There are very few sites appearing more than once.
<br />5.3 - Recount Cohort Counts, List Counts - Table of counts. There are five variants called at the same place in three different families across the three lists.
<br />7.1 - Their DNV Calls Flagged as Mosaic Child in Our List - Nearly half of our mosaic calls are called in the DNV list. These are expectingly higher in AF relative to all of the calls.
<br />7.2 - Their DNV Calls Flagged as Germline Child in Our List - We find 97% of our Germline Child calls in the DNV list. The ones we donâ€™t find have mildly less depth.</p>
