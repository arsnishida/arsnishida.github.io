I"a<p>Mosaics - The progress report was finished and the majority of the processing and organization of the data is now complete. There are errors somewhere in the categorical classification of the putative variants and the next step is to figure out from where they are occuring. For this initial pass I have only looked at simplex quad families and now I can take another pass through the scripts and code to work on the multiple quad and trio families. As Iâ€™m going through this next pass I will make a more formal writeup and recording of the methods and where everything is located here on this blog.</p>
