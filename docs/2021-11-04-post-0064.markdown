This describes the maintence of O'Roak and Adey lab contamination references.

Smaller contamination sequences are held here for use with FASTQC: `*PENDING*`
<br>Larger contermination sequences are held here for alignment: `/home/groups/oroaklab/refs/contamination/refs`

Please keep references in FA format, separated by individual names, named by their accession reference, and with this accession in the header. The totality of the FA's are concatenated into a single BWA index.

Here is a rough framework of an alignment and quick summary to these resources:
```
# refresh contamination references
bash /home/groups/oroaklab/refs/contamination/setup.sh

# copy demuxed reads
ln -s /home/groups/oroaklab/demultiplex/211103_NS500556_0533_AHC7V5AFX3/*SA* .

# align
bwa mem -M -t 32 /home/groups/oroaklab/refs/contamination/contamination.fa 211103_NS500556_0533_AHC7V5AFX3.s3_10bp.SA.R1.fq.gz 211103_NS500556_0533_AHC7V5AFX3.s3_10bp.SA.R2.fq.gz > align_to_contamination.sam

# report
cat align_to_contamination.sam | grep -v "^@" | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c

# output
#2331010 *
#6024366 NC_000913.3
# 769709 NC_004718.3
```
