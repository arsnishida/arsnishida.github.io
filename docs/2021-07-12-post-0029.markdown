ChromVAR was run with R v4.0.0 using the JASPAR 2020 motif database for mm10. This was performed on the data filtered at the TSS 1.5 threshold.

Here are the variabilities plotted in order where the motifs are slightly different from the 1.5 thresholded version: [Variability FIgure](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kcz824kl28c21wc/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_variability.png?dl=0)

Motifs like [NEUROD1 (Deviations UMAP)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jdm5st6kcjttic/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_NEUROD1.png?dl=0) and [LHX9 (Deviations UMAP)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9plgj38wfd0cb1b/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_LHX9.png?dl=0) remain top hits with similar distributions as the 2.7 versions.

We get enrichment of [KLF9 (Deviations UMAP)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/af88qnznirb5iya/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_KLF9.png?dl=0) motifs as well but it follows a similar distribution of motifs like [CTCF (Deviations UMAP)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ap8ek6p7ecw4c0/blog_tmp1_chromVAR1p5_CTCF.png?dl=0). These show enrichment in the high TSS enriched cells relative to low TSS enriched cells so I'm not convinced these are representative of anything interesting. We would really want to find a motif with the opposite distribution (high enrichment for a motif in the low TSS cells and low motif enrichment in the high TSS cells) to say those lower TSS cells had something worthwhile.
