Joint coverage plots were created separately for simplex quads, multiplex quads, and simplex trios. These count the number of bases over 52 thresholds (from the range of needing 1-250 counts) for each member of a family, the total of the family, and the average of the family. These are subset into six regions, non-SDTRF (CDS) sites and SDTRF sites and then those are split into autosomal, X, and Y chromosomes.

Coverage plots are in the following markdown. At a threshold of 5x coverage still only less than half of the bases are covered. [figure-01]
