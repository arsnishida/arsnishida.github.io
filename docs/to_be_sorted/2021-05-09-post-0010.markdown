To address the lack of discrete clustering we used previously generated data from Casey to anchor our data.

Using Casey's peak set alone with the data creates a bit more separation. Though maybe it is mostly from how small and transparent I plotted the points on the UMAP. [figure-01]

Direct coembedding of the data together fails. Datasets are completely separated. [figure-02]

\- Setting up the Arrow file with coembedded data, `run_archr_1_setup.Rscript`.
<br>- Preliminary analysis with the coembedded data, `run_archr_2_coembed.Rscript`.
<br>- Commands for merging datasets and using the alternative peak set, `run_coembed.txt`.
