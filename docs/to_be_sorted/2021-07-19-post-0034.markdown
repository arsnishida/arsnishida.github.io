Here are some of the UMAPs and how they were plot in 3d. They look as expected, similar to the 2D versions. The Bio Cluster one might indicate that one of the pg's labeled as excitatory should be better labeled as undetermined.

This markdown contains two parts for various figures. The first part shows the DA results from comparing pg 1 and pg 12 in the data filtered at TSS > 1.5. The second part contains a comparison of the results from running ChromVAR on the two TSS > 1.5 and 2.7 datasets.

Markdown Notes:
<br>1.2 - Plot PVALS - These are terribly skewed suggesting the test itself is not a good choice.
<br>1.3 - Plot FDRS - These end up all as 1 due to the issue above.
<br>2.3 - Plot Variability, Spearman - The overall variabilities are well correlated with a few outliers from the KLF family.
<br>2.4 - Show KLF9 and CTCF Score Correlations - The deviation scores from ChromVAR run on the TSS > 1.5 dataset are compared for KLF9 and CTCF. KLF9 is a variable motif under the 1.5 dataset but not the 2.7 dataset. It has a similar pattern and distribution to CTCF but this show the scores aren't well correlated suggesting it isn't simply an indication of quality like CTCF usually indicates.
