ChromVAR was run with R v4.0.0 using the JASPAR 2020 motif database for mm10. This was performed on the data filtered at the TSS 2.7 threshold.

Here are the variabilities plotted in order where the motifs NEUROD1 and NEUROG2 show considerably greater variation: [Variability Figure](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2aplfvnqe35mlxk/blog_tmp1_chromVARvariability.png?dl=0)

Here is the UMAP with the deviation scores of NEUROD1 overlaid: [NEUROD1 Deviations UMAP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0r46yntageg2gny/blog_tmp1_chromVAR_NEUROD1.png?dl=0)

Here is another high variability motif, LHX9, that is found with a somewhat opposite distribution across the cells: [LHX9 Deviations UMAP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/apb4wdw2mhxv8qj/blog_tmp1_chromVAR_LHX9.png?dl=0)
