There are nine Numbers spreadsheets in the folder, one for each of the lists. As a refresher to how the original set was manually annotated, we both only annotated the MOSAIC_CHILD calls and you created four specific categories for the ones that were removed. The categories are largely describing instances of indels and where they are found. There's a slide on the post with examples of the four categories and your specific note added on to it.
