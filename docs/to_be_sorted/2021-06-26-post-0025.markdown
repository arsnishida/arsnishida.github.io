This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup. Here I am plotting preliminary coverage figures and getting SNV counts by grouping. This is just on the quad simplex files.

This is similar to the previous post but with histograms instead of boxplots for SNV counting with and without families with 0 counts removed from the plots.

These were the filter Deidre used at one point to identify outlying families that are in the ballpark of the counts we have.
```
mosaic_c        45x 5%, adjusted >=10 calls
mosaic_nontrans 45x 5%, adjusted >=12 calls
germline_c      45x 5%, adjusted >=12 calls
mosaic_trans    45x 5%, adjusted >= 6 calls
```

Notes per section:
<br>4.4 - Plot / Mosaic Child - There is a single Proband from a family with 12 counts which is a clear outlier with every other family having less than 5 counts.
<br>4.7 - Plot / Germline Child - There is a single Sibling from a family with 8 counts where every other family has 5 or less.
<br>4.10 - Plot / Mosaic Parental Non-Trans - There are two Mothers from families with 8 and 9 counts with every other family having 5 or less.
<br>4.13 - Plot / Mosaic Parental Trans - There are no families with higher than 5 counts.
