This shows the cistopic topics projected onto the UMAP. And it contains boxplots of the pertinent cell subsets and their topic scores per subset.

UMAPS are also located here: `/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/sc_tmp1/encode_DHS_index/third_pass_filt_TSS2p7/tbr1_ko_encodeDHSindex_finalfilter.filt.cistopic.30.UMAP.matrix_plots`.
