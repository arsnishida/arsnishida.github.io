This replicates Figure 5 from original paper using the now defunct final simplex quad list looking at synonymous SNVs and their distances from splice sites.

Markdown Notes:
<br>3.2 - Plot Densities, Match Fig 5 - The splice distances here show the opposite of what was observed before, they are further from splice sites. They are nonetheless different in distribution.
