Calling peaks on this data doesn’t work because it is too noisy. Using Casey’s cleaner peak set was working a bit better. Tiling helps sparse amounts of data but won’t help with noise. This peak set is basically Casey’s peak set+. List is from here: [biorxiv paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.26.172718v3).

If the data wasn’t as noisy then calling peaks specifically across this dataset is the best approach. You’d even get novel peaks. But with technically poor data the technical methods alone do not seem to be working. Using biologically motivated references however seems to select appropriate sites for consideration in dimensionality reduction. [figure-01]

Since this seems to be working, the dimensionality reduction needs to be re-run with filtering and doublet removal. Doublet removal on a dataset this size is giving memory issues so I am moving it to Exacloud.
