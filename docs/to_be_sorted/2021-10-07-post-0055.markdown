There are 135 conditions so it is impossible to do pairwise comparisons between everything. Cluster comparisons were made between C_1 to C_9. And then for each of the individual 9 clusters, I did the treatments within time (same day but different strain) and between time (same strain but different day). This ignores cross strain and cross day comparisons (like CS_5 vs. WT_CS_30). The DA was performed after TF normalization using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
