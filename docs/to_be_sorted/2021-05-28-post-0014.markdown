These are the results from comparing all the clusters against one another to look for differentially accessible peaks. I performed a term factor transformation to adjust for depth and compared cells by pheograph cluster annotation via the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Peaks are annotated to their nearest gene and p-values are corrected with an FDR correction.

The FDR correction does not work on this dataset. There are +1M peaks but peaks with p-values of < 0.01 are usually in the few hundreds or lower. The FDR correction ends up setting everything to 1. For now, just use the regular p-values. Probably start it at a threshold of 0.01 but you can move it up to 0.05 or even higher if desirable. I left the files with the FDR column in there with the suffix FDR but they won't be of use.

Here's an example of how I'd start parsing through the data. This example would show you the nearby genes that have statistically different peaks between pg_10 and pg_11. This example yields 55 results which is consistent with what we normally see from this analysis (and also a friendly number for humans to parse through).
```
# open the file, filter for peaks with a pvalue < 0.01, filter for peaks +/- 10000bp to a TSS, pull out gene names, sort, print unique results
# move the thresholds as desired
cat DA_pg.pg_10_pg_11.txt | awk '$7 < 0.01' | awk '$10 < 10000 && $10 > -10000' | cut -f 9 | sort | uniq
```
