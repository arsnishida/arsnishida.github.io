*UPDATE* Oct 12 - Nothing changed but as a note, the multiplex quad labels are left as 'PRO' and 'SIB' despite being both affected for these plots since they are looking at the technical labels and details.

These are the allele frequency distribution plots before with the final filters added. These are done with simplex quads individually, then adding the simplex trios, and then adding the multiplex quads.
