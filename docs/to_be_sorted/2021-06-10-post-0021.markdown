The list of gene names are taken directly from the files used previously except for the newer FUSIL list. They are taken from the following references:
<br>[Essential gene list](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003484), 2455 genes
<br>[EXAC gene lists](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19057), 3232 genes (Intolerant), 4555 genes (Mid), 10264 genes (Tolerant)
<br>[FUSIL gene list](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14284-2), 163 genes

Annotations of the base positions are taken from Annovar's hg38 RefSeq reference (2018-06-15). Previously, the appropriate annotations were pulled with a simple grep and throwing out anything annotated as antisense '-AS' as such:
```
while read gene ; do 
  grep -w $gene /home/groups/oroaklab/refs/GRCh37/Homo_sapiens_refseq_cds_splice_with_gene_and_SDTRF.txt | grep -v \-AS.\> | grep -vw SDTRF >> geneset_pos_cds_exac_tolerant.txt
  grep -w $gene /home/groups/oroaklab/refs/GRCh37/Homo_sapiens_refseq_cds_splice_with_gene_and_SDTRF.txt | grep -v \-AS.\> | grep -w SDTRF >> geneset_pos_sdtrf_exac_tolerant.txt
done < ~/tmp/Exac.Tol.genes
```
Annotations now are done by looking for exact matches of the gene name parsing every name after spliting the annotation field by both ',' and ';'.

Gene names were originally derived from older hg19 annotations. Gene names that were not found in hg38 by the same name were replaced with their updated name taken from [GeneCards.org](http://www.GeneCards.org). Gene name changes are preserved in the directory and the usable gene name lists are below and in the main index of files.

The small, following list of genes remained missing after this replacement and also could not be found by any of their other alternate names, `/home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/spark_mosaic/refs/cds_splice_sites/annovar_hg38/genesets/missing.txt`. The contents of the file are below for perusing and mostly consist of pseudogenes and RNA-genes. It is likely these were not designed to be captured in this sequencing.
```
# Bases annotated with these genes by Annovar were absent. Multiple names for the genes were consulted via GeneCards.org.

FUSIL list and ESSENTIAL list had the presence of all genes.

EXAC INTOL LIST:
1 RNA gene(s) - SNAR-A6

EXAC MID LIST:
5 protein-coding gene(s) - ZNF487, CCDC163, ZNF738, RPSAP58, MFSD14C
7 pseudogene(s) - ANKRD20A4P, FAM153CP, SEPT7P9, TCP10L3, TMEM14EP, TMPRSS11BNL, FMO6P
7 RNA gene(s) - MIR9-1HG, IRF1-AS1, LINC02897, LINC00696, ST20-AS1, PRNT, TMEM256-PLSCR3

EXAC TOL LIST:
5 protein-coding gene(s) - LILRA3, PRR21, GSTT1, GOLGA8S, ZNF724
8 pseudogene(s) - PCDHB17P, FRG1BP, ATP5F1EP2, ZNF812P, FAM183BP, EP400P1, GABARAPL3, TTLL13
21 RNA gene(s) - LINC01588, PIK3CD-AS1, LINC01599, LINC01600, C5orf55, LINC02915, ZNF436-AS1, RAD51L3-RFFL, TLX1NB, GAS8-AS1, C1orf220, LINC01098, LINC01559, CLLU1, ARHGAP19-SLIT1, LINC01465, ARRDC1-AS1, LINC01565, IGF2BP2-AS1, NDUFV1-DT, DSCR4
1 chimeric gene(s) - ERCC6-PGBD3
```

Gene set joint coverage files for the burden analysis were made using these five gene lists.
