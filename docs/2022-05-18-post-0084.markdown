Here is the copy of the steps for using Docker on our cluster and running the Celsee pipeline. You do need sudo privileges to run this and/or setup from ACC to get Docker running.
```
Celsee Analysis Steps

1. Start Docker
I would suggest not normally having Docker running in the background, only bring it up when you want to use it. Installed via convenience scripts.
Theoretically(?) this is the only step that requires sudo privileges OR a sudo user to grant privileges to run Docker: `sudo usermod -aG docker lowensev`.
$ sudo service docker start

2. Verify that Docker is running
$ systemctl status docker

3. Import in the Celsee pipeline as a Docker image
I have it just living in my directories.
$ cd /home/groups/oroaklab/nishida/celsee/celsee_analysis
$ bash import.sh 

4. Verify that the image was imported
$ docker images

5. Run Celsee pipeline
- The output location is also used as a temp directory which is a problem.
- But also Docker requires the drives be mounted into Docker and we can't mount anything in /home/groups/. Instead go to /tmp and copy everything over.
- You also need sudo privileges to write the output (this is how it is in the manual and I still can't believe this).
- When running as sudo, acc does weird things to group/user privileges so you need to copy EVERYTHING into the /tmp directory.
- Copy over the config file, the fastqs, all reference files, and the entirety of the celsee-analysis script folder (I think you only need some of these copied but do everything to be safe).
- Also, in the config file, the optional fields are actually required to run and FASTQ files MUST end with either '.fastq' or '.fastq.gz'.
$ # move ALL files to a directory in /tmp
$ sudo python3 run_celsee.py eve_test.config . output Human_GRCh38_genomeSAsparseD3

6. Copy output folder back to /home/groups and delete the /tmp directory

7. Remove the Celsee analysis pipeline image
$ docker image rm celsee-analysis

8. And then shut down Docker (also needs sudo privileges)
$ sudo service docker stop
```
