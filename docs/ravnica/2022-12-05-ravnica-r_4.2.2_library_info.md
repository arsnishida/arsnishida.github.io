I installed libraries in R either through CRAN or Bioconductor. These base libraries were chosen to fulfill a contemporary processing downstream analysis pipeline that Ryan uses for scATAC-seq.

These were then copied to `/home/groups/ravnica/env/R_library_backups/R-4.2.2_copy` and set to write-only. This represents a frozen set of libraries that one could use. I'd suggest people copy these to a new environment directory or their own working directory and build on top of them rather than installing directly into the main R library location. But you are otherwise free to install libraries with R however individually desired.

R will find libraries on this path:
```
export R_LIBS_USER='/home/groups/ravnica/env/R_library_backups/R-4.2.2_copy'
```

R will then use the default path AND the new path. If you want to make sure something installs only to your path you should set it to just your path and check to make sure only your path shows up.
```
# check path to make sure it only shows up
$ .libPaths()

...

# assign a single specific path
$ assign(".lib.loc", "/home/groups/ravnica/env/R_library_backups/R-4.2.2_copy", envir = environment(.libPaths))

# check path to make sure it only shows up
$ .libPaths()
```

The libraries for the pipeline are:
```
# major
library(ArchR)
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratWrappers)
library(Signac)
library(chromVAR)
library(ggplot2)
library(cisTopic)
library(infercnv)

library(patchwork)
library(reshape2)
library(parallel)
library(stringr)
library(ggrepel)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)
library(Matrix)
library(BiocParallel)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(AUCell)
library(TFBSTools)

# bio refs
library(rtracklayer)
library(GenomeInfoDb)
library(EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene)
library(JASPAR2020)

# extra plotting
