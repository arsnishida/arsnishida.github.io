References are regenerated from ANNOVAR. Comparisons between this Annovar 2018 hg38 reference and the current 2021 reference are here showing > 99% bases present in the older version relative to the newer. [figure-01]

Joint coverage across families were recalled with this new reference and with the small bug fixed (coverage counts are no longer off by 1).

Joint coverage plots were recreated separately for simplex quads, multiplex quads, and simplex trios. These count the number of bases over 52 thresholds (from the range of needing 1-250 counts) for each member of a family, the total of the family, and the average of the family.  These are subset into six regions, non-SDTRF (CDS) sites and SDTRF sites and then those are split into autosomal, X, and Y chromosomes.

Coverage plots are in the following markdown. There is now appropriate coverage across the exome and thresholds can be picked. [figure-02]
