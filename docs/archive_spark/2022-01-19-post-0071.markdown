This markdown takes the pre-filtered data and plots out the metrics that are used for scoring by the logistic model. All variants are plotted and then just the subset of mosaic child calls.

This data represents the simplex quads only. It uses the broad filter and removes parental germline calls.
```
A broad filter to reduce computational load is used.
- Frequent variants appearing 5 or more times are removed from further analysis.
- Common variant allele frequencies determined from ExAC and gnomAD annotations must be less than 0.005.
- Variants require at least 3 non-reference reads and at least 8 reads in all four family members.
- Variants must also fall within exonic or splicing regions from RefSeq annotations.
```
