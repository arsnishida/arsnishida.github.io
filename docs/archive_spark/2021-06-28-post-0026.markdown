This is the first pass through the data, getting it organized, and the framework for reiteration of these analyses setup. Here I am plotting out the fraction of allele frequencies we seeing across the different variant fractions and by person. This is just on the quad simplex files.

Notes per section:
<br>4 - Plots of All AF Densities - These look in line with what we expect.
<br>5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2 - Plots Relative to Old, Original Data - All of this newer data is slightly right-shifted relative to the older data. This is due to the older data having more depth and more capable of getting smaller AF's and is expected.
<br>5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.3 - Plots with and without Filters - The filters are pretty conservative but are taking out a large number of calls aggressively on the lower-end. The numbers of calls being thrown out from these filters are large but expected (mainly just getting rid of calls with fewer than 5 alt reads).
<br>9 - Plots with and without Transmission Filters - This also shows how dramatic the PSAME and higher PHET threshold are for removing false parental transmission calls. The higher PHET threshold does seem to eliminate more calls on the higher end of AF.
