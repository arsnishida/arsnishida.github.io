Here is a list of the final SP ID's and their family that are ultimately used in our analysis.
<br>[Final Sample List](https://www.dropbox.com/s/awrb72bkxcxgmix/final_sample_list.txt?dl=0)

These are the total number of families used in the analysis and where they disappear during our filtering. The first round of filtering is technical -- either the variant calls failed or the family was missing a member to continue. The second round of filtering is based on the figure in this [post](https://arsnishida.github.io/2021/07/26/post-0038.html) based on read depths and variant call numbers.

```
Simplex Quads:
    2623 families on the list
    2618 after first round of filtering: SF0096166, SF0096198, SF0096218, SF0137614, SF0136205
    2616 after second round of filtering: SF0087337, SF0035804

Multiplex Quads:
    559 families on the list
    558 after first round of filtering: SF0139094
    554 after second round of filtering: SF0096657, SF0113816, SF0086926, SF0132432

Simplex Trios:
    2200 families on the list
    2196 after first round of filtering: SF0128793, SF0130451, SF0136742, SF0138832
    2192 after second round of filtering: SF0026651, SF0017418, SF0020602, SF0083949
