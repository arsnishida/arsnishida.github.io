The SSC list was transformed from hg19 to hg38 as described [here](https://arsnishida.github.io/2021/11/30/post-0066.html).

20 sites were removed for having no original FRACTION assignment. 172 sites removed for falling into a SDTRF region in going from hg19 to hg38. 9 sites were removed for having no functional mutation type (both originally and after reannotation). There were 7 mosaic child sites lost in this fashion. 1 had no mutation type in both hg19 and hg38. The other 6 fell in super duplicate regions with 3 of them being within 100 bp of each other constituting a complex event.

This recreates the burden analysis from the original SSC paper. The trends match but the n's and signficance do not. This is due to the family list and potentially the LGD/NS lists. The family lists include hundreds more families than the original analysis and are taken from 'cohort_all_families_list.table'. The LGD/NS lists were taken from 'Family_Subcohort_Designations.xlsx'. These were found in our Box directory:
