The DA was performed after TF normalization using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and creates the comparisons in '210712_DA_Comparisons.txt'. Mild name changes were made in the comparisons such as 'Photoreceptor' to 'Photoreceptors' to match the annotation file and using the correct annotation column for the biologically split subsets.

The following comparisons are nonexistant because they have no cells with the annotation:
```
- Glia_WT_CS_5_C13 has no cells so all 6 comparisons are missing in 3_Glia_d5.
- Glia_KI_CS_30_C21, Glia_dTaudel_30_C13, Glia_KI_CS_30_C13 in 3_Glia_d30.
```

The following comparisons are deliberately empty because they have too few cells:
```
- DA.Glia_WT_CS_30_C11_Glia_PL_CS_30_C11.txt, DA.Glia_WT_CS_30_C13_Glia_CS_30_C13.txt
- DA.Neuron_WT_CS_30_C14_Neuron_dTaudel_30_C14.txt, DA.Neuron_WT_CS_30_C14_Neuron_PL_CS_30_C14.txt
- DA.Photoreceptors_WT_CS_30_C1_Photoreceptors_PL_CS_30_C1.txt, DA.Photoreceptors_WT_CS_30_C3_Photoreceptors_dTaudel_30_C3.txt, DA.Photoreceptors_WT_CS_30_C3_Photoreceptors_KI_CS_30_C3.txt, DA.Photoreceptors_WT_CS_30_C3_Photoreceptors_PL_CS_30_C3.txt, DA.Photoreceptors_WT_CS_30_C3_Photoreceptors_VM_CS_30_C3.txt
```
