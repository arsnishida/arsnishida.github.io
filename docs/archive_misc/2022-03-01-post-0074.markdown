Here's instructions for using rclone on our clusters specifically using a remote/headless machine. This requires more setup but skips the use of X11.

1. Download rclone on your personal home computer, https://rclone.org/downloads/.
2. Go to mays/mccovey/bonds and load the rclone modules, `module load rclone`.
3. Setup rclone on mays/mccovey/bonds, `rclone config`.
4. Inside rclone's configuration, setup the following:
	- 'n' for new remote at the 'n/s/q' prompt
	- a shortcut name for the storage at the 'name' prompt, I am just calling it ONEDRIVE
	- 'onedrive' for the 'Storage' prompt
	- press enter to skip the prompt 'client_id'
	- press enter to skip the prompt 'client_secret'
	- 'global' for the prompt 'region'
	- 'n' to not edit the advanced configurations at 'y/n'
	- 'n' to setup on the headless node at 'y/n'
	- leave this open for a moment
5. On your personal home computer run `rclone authorize "onedrive"`. This will open your web browser and ask you to log into your OneDrive account. This then returns a long configuration string to copy.
6. Paste the configuration key back on the config in mays/mccovey/bonds.
7. Finish configuration:
	- confirm the configuration as 'onedrive' at the prompt 'config_type'
	- confirm 'y' at the URL confirmation of 'y/n'
	- confirm 'y' for setup at the last prompt 'y/n'
	- 'q' to quit out and you should be set up
8. Send a test file. This should send the test file to your OneDrive account setup with the name "ONEDRIVE" to the directory Documents/
```
echo "THIS IS A TEST FILE" > test.txt
rclone copy test.txt ONEDRIVE:Documents/
```
