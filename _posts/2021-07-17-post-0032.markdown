This is a first pass through the data for the multiplex quad families for the purposes of outlier detection.

Link to markdown:
<br>[Preliminary Outlier Analysis for Quad Multiplex Calls, part 6a]()
<br>[Preliminary Outlier Analysis for Quad Multiplex Calls, part 6b]()

Notes per section from 7a:
<br>4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - Appears similarly to simplex quads. There isn't a tail. No filtering recommended again.
Notes per section from 7b:
<br>4.2 - Decile Plot for Joint Coverage Families - Appears similarly to simplex quads. There isn't a tail. No filtering recommended again.
