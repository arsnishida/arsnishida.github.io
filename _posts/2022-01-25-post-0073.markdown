These are the step to upload and download from the console to and from Dropbox.
<br>1. Go to: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
<br>2. Create an App. Name is whatever you like but probably something like "Dropbox Access".
<br>3. Navigate to Permissions on the top tab. Check account_info.write, account_info.read, files.metadata.write, files.metadata.read, files.content.write, and files.content.read.
<br>4. Navigate to Settings on the top tab. Generate your access token. If you change your permissions you must regenerate your access token. Always keep your API key secret or else anybody can use it to access everything in your Dropbox.

Upload Instructions. This will upload file, 'test.txt', into your Dropbox folder 'temp_upload' under the name 'uploaded_test_file.txt'.
```
# create test file
echo "TEST THIS" > test.txt

# fill these variables in
API_KEY="keep your API key secret"
INPUT_PATH="test.txt"
DROPBOX_FILE_PATH="/temp_upload/uploaded_test_file.txt"

# run
curl -X POST https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/upload \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer ${API_KEY}" \
    --header "Dropbox-API-Arg: {\"path\": \"${DROPBOX_FILE_PATH}\"}" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
    --data-binary @${INPUT_PATH}
```

Download Instructions. This will download 'uploaded_test_file.txt' in Dropbox directory 'temp_upload' as 'downloaded_test_file.txt
```
# fill these variables in
