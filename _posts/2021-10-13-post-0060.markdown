*Update Oct 13*. Updated to add 0 counts for families with absent calls.

This is an extension of the burden analysis but here we are keeping only damaging missense calls by thresholding on REVEL scores >= 0.50. This eliminates many of the calls but does produce a stronger signal in comparing probands to siblings. REVEL scores are available in the supplmental annotation folder.
