This is the gene set burden analysis using the final burdens table. This breaks the variants into categories dependent on if they are Germline LGD or Germline NS and looks at the gene sets and areas under the lists for EXINTOL and ESSENTIAL. The same one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test is performed and does not find evidence of mosaic burden in the subsets.

This differs from previous passes in that I am using the complete final list and am plotting all categories of mutations for quad simplex lists alone and the quad simplex list with the trio simplex list like in the Krupp paper. When stacking the trio simplex probands onto the rest of the data like it is in the paper we do see a significant enrichment of burden in the probands.
